# ALLTHEDOCS Documentation

ALLTHEDOCS is a *simple* tool to help you generate software documentation for both users and
developers using markdown. The big difference to other documentation solutions is that ALLTHEDOCS
can also parse your source code and turns your comments into beautiful documentation as well!

Of course, we have a [user manual](user/index.md) for all the docs, generated by ALLTHEDOCS.
And if you're a developer and want to help improve ALLTHEDOCS or just curious how it works,
check out the [developer manual](dev/index.md), which was generated using ALLTHEDOCS as well.
