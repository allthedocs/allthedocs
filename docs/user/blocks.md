# Blocks

Allthedocs enhances the usual markdown syntax with a syntax for specifying blocks with CSS
classes.

A block in your markdown looks like this:

    /---- some-class another-class
    This is some *markdown-formatted* text.
    ----/

The following built-in blocks are available:


## Warning block

If you want to give a warning to the reader, this block type is a good choice. It looks like this:

/---- warning
This is a **warning** block!
----/

You can write such a block like this:

    /---- warning
    This is a **warning** block!
    ----/


## Info block

An info block can be used for asides or other information that should be visually separate from
the normal content. It looks like this:

/---- info
This is an **info** block.
----/

An info block can be written like such:

    /---- info
    This is an **info** block.
    ----/
