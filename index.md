# Create All The Docs with allthedocs

Need a simple documentation solution that works with both markdown files and
markdown-formatted comments in your source code? Then look no further, because that's
exactly what allthedocs is all about.

A fair warning: this project is very young (< v1.0.0) and the API will probably change and
evolve rapidly.


## Features

* Turns markdown files and source code comments into beautiful HTML documentation
* Requires almost no setup
* Keeps the original directory layout so that you always know how to link between files
* Generates a site navigation from your config
* Easily add more languages to be parsed
* Allows to specify files and directories to be ignored

* [Documentation](docs/index.md)
 * [README: Quickstart Guide](README.md)
 * [User Manual](docs/user/index.md)
 * [Developer Manual](docs/dev/index.md)
